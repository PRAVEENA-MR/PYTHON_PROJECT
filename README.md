# PYTHON_PROJECT
Working with a dataset from ABC company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The company requires a comprehensive report detailing information about their employees across various teams. Tasks include preprocessing the dataset, analyzing the data, and presenting  findings graphically. Here's a breakdown of what need to do:
Preprocessing:
Correct the data in the "height" column by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180. Ensure data consistency and integrity before proceeding with analysis. 

Analysis Tasks:
1. Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees. <br>
2. Segregate employees based on their positions within the company. 
3. Identify the predominant age group among employees. 
4. Discover which team and position have the highest salary expenditure. 
5. Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually.

   # Preprocessing
   First and foremost imported libraries and Loaded the dataset.Then performed data exploration using different available functions. 
   Prepossing Steps includes
   1.finding and deleting duplicated rows in the dataset
   2.Values in height column is not valid ,so generated random numbers between 150 and 180 for 'Height' column and changed datatype
   3.Finding and deleted null values which is very less compared to size of dataset
   4.Replaced null value in salary column by salary mean

   
   3.
